# Prepositions Visualization
This web app is built using the three js library and shows Spanish prepositions (e.g. encima de, sobre, al lado de, debajo de, delante de) in their respective spatial locations. As a beginer Spanish learner, it helped me remember the terms in a hands-on, visual way. Drag, scroll, and use the arrow keys to navigate the space. Be sure to check inside the house!

Quick Start:
1. Clone this repo
2. Run <code>npm install</code> to install dependencies
3. Run <code>npm run build</code> to compile the build file with webpack
4. Launch index.html on a local server 


My takeaway from this project: I gained a greater understanding of package management technologies, namely npm, browserify, and webpack. Three JS seemed overwhelming to use in the beginning, but with a bit of dedication to reading the docs, it turned out to be a really fun tool!
