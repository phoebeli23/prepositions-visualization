# Prepositions Visualization
Experimentation with three js 3D-modeling library. Orbit controls allow for movement around the space. (Take a look inside the house!)

To launch locally:
1. Clone this repo
2. Run <code>npm install</code> to install dependencies
3. Run <code>npm run build</code> to compile the build file with webpack
4. Launch index.html on a local server 

Takeaway from this project: I gained a greater understanding of package management technologies, namely npm, browserify, and webpack. Three JS seemed overwhelming to use in the beginning, but with a bit of dedication to reading the docs, it turned out to be a really fun tool!
